# Book Donation / Konyvkucko

This is my third Milestone Project on the Full Stack Web Developer Code Institute course. For Data Centric Development module.

### Summary

I am the founder of Könyvkuckó, the Hungarian Children's Library in Ireland. My book collection is about 120 books, all our books were donated. I got books from authors, organizations, individuals. The launch of the Hungarian children's book was on the 29th of October, 2019. The books are hosted by Deansgrange Library, but they can be requested via the inter-library loans system from other libraries who are part of Libraries Ireland. The requested books will be delivered to the users' local library.

#### Project purpose: 

The purpose of the project is to build a full-stack site that allows the users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

The application allows users to search Hungarian children's books, check the wishlist and donate books either from our wishlist or any book they want. Only the admin can add new books to the database, delete and edit the existing books.

#### Main Technologies:

* Required: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB


## UX

#### User stories:

* As a user I would like to know about the books that are available to borrow from Libraries Ireland

* As a user I would like to get from a book to the Library's homepage to borrow the book

* As a user I would like to be able to donate books to the Hungarian Collection

* As a user I would like to access the Wishlist to see which books are needed by the library

* As a user I would like to be able to contact Konyvkucko with my questions

#### Admin stories:

* As an admin I would like to be able to add books to the collection and delete/ edit them

* As an admin I want to be sure that I approve all the books which appears on our donation page

* As an admin I want to be able to move books from wishlist to donation list

#### Design and colors:

#### Fonts:

I used Nunito Sans, from Google Fonts

On fonts.google.com in the about section the description of the font is the following: Nunito is a well balanced sans serif typeface superfamily, with 2 versions: The project began with Nunito, created by Vernon Adams as a rounded terminal sans serif for display typography. Jacques Le Bailly extended it to a full set of weights, and an accompanying regular non-rounded terminal version, Nunito Sans.

Sans-serif is used as the default backup font in case when Nunito Sans was not possible to load.

#### Colors:

* ![#4284A4](https://placehold.it/15/4284A4/000000?text=+) `#4284A4` - Primary background color

* ![#60a0bf](https://placehold.it/15/60a0bf/000000?text=+) `#60a0bf` - Buuton hover color, Form input field label color, Datepicker hover color

* ![#5B8BA3](https://placehold.it/15/5B8BA3/000000?text=+) `#5B8BA3` - 404 page text block background color


#### Wireframes:

Originally on the home page I wanted to have one background picture and 3 of our latest donated books, but then I discovered Parallax (Materialize). Parallax is an effect where the background image is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.
